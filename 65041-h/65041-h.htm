</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My dear sir</span>:</p>

<p>Perhaps I have taken too great a liberty in
sending to you in this public manner, and in
praying you to accept a copy of M. Flourens’
ingenious work. I have a very sincere desire
that you should read the Inquiry; for I feel
sure, that if you approve of it, the studious
portion of our countrymen who may peruse it,
will concur in the opinion of a gentleman so
justly distinguished as yourself in every good
word and work, and so capable of judging as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
to the salutary or evil tendency of the productions
of our teeming press.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as many of our countrymen have
heretofore felt, and many do now feel, desirous
to know the truth as to the question of the
multiple nature of the human mind, I have
here translated the Examination, in order that
they might have an opportunity to learn what
is thought of Gall’s doctrines by one of the
best and most precise thinkers in Europe.</p>

<p>Professor Flourens, by his writings on the
brain and nervous system, by his courses of
lectures at the Jardin des Plantes, by numerous
writings on various scientific subjects, by his
position in the Institute, has acquired a place
among the literary and scientific celebrities of
the present age. The amiable and elegant
manners, and the fine disposition of this distinguished
character, coincide with his acknowledged
learning, and exactness, and zeal, to
accumulate upon him the public respect and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
esteem. It is therefore with great confidence
that I present to you this copy of his criticism
upon Phrenology, since I suppose that every
writing of so good a man might prove acceptable
to you, and to the studious portion of our
countrymen generally.</p>

<p>I invoke your approbation of what I cannot
but deem a masterly criticism of the doctrines
of Gall. So highly have I appreciated it, that
I cannot readily suppose it possible to rise
from its perusal, without being convinced that
Gall was wholly mistaken in his views of
the human mind; and of course, that all the
cranioscopists, mesmerizers, and diviners, who
have followed his track, or risen up on the
basis of his opinions, are equally in error.</p>

<p>In order to have a just view of human
responsibility, it is indispensable to entertain
the justest notions of the nature of the human
mind. If Phrenology <i>be an unsubstantial
hypothesis</i>, no phrenologist is fit to be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
juror, a judge, or a legislator: for since all
human law—the whole social compact—and
indeed all divine law, as relative to human
propensities and actions—is founded on some
real nature of the soul and mind, there is risk
that manifestly erroneous conceptions of the
freewill, of the conscience, of the judgment,
and the perceptive powers, &amp;c. may mislead
the juror, the judge, and the legislator, in their
vote, their opinion, and their notion of rights
and wrongs.</p>

<p>If I am correct in entertaining these apprehensions
as to the influence of false metaphysics
on the public characters I have enumerated,
there is abundant cause to rejoice when a blow
is struck, like that pulverizing blow which is
given in this work, to so considerable an error.
There are thousands among the young and
ardent and curious of our countrymen and
countrywomen, whose minds may be likewise
led astray from the truth; but if it be mischievous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
for the judge and the juror and the
legislator to entertain erroneous views upon
the nature of the understanding, the mind,
or the soul, it is equally to be deprecated
where the error is sown broadcast in the land.</p>

<p>Tares, if not in themselves poisonous, serve
at best to choke up the useful or beautiful
plants that ought to be cultivated in the fields
of science or morals; but you will find that
M. Flourens regards them as poisons.</p>

<p>Has not M. Flourens clearly refuted the
phrenologists? and has he not, in doing so,
performed a useful and an acceptable service?</p>

<p>I pray you to believe that I am, with the
most grateful respect and the sincerest esteem,</p>

<p class="center">Your obliged and faithful servant,</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AUTHOR’S PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>Having been a witness to the progress of
phrenology, I was led to the composition of
the following treatise.</p>

<p>Each succeeding age has a philosophy of
its own.</p>

<p>The seventeenth century recovered from
the philosophy of Descartes; the eighteenth
recovered from that of Locke and Condillac:
is the nineteenth to recover from that of Gall?</p>

<p>This is a really important question.</p>

<p>I propose, in this work, to examine phrenology
as it appears in the writings of Gall,
of Spurzheim, and of Broussais.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span></p>

<p>My wish is to be brief. There is, however,
one great secret in the art of being brief:
it is to be clear.</p>

<p>I frequently quote Descartes: I even go
further; for I dedicate my work to his memory.
I am writing in opposition to a bad
philosophy, while I am endeavouring to recall
a sound one.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I.<br />
OF GALL.<br />
<span class="smaller">OF HIS DOCTRINE IN GENERAL.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The great work in which Gall sets forth his
doctrine is well known.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> That work shall
serve as the groundwork of my examination.
I shall examine in succession each of the
questions studied by the author; merely introducing
some slight changes in the order in
which they are arranged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>The entire doctrine of Gall is contained in
two fundamental propositions, of which the
first is, that understanding resides exclusively
in the brain, and the second, that each particular
faculty of the understanding is provided
in the brain with an organ proper to itself.</p>

<p>Now, of these two propositions, there is
certainly nothing new in the first one, and
perhaps nothing true in the second one.</p>

<p>Let us commence our examination with the
first proposition.</p>

<p>I say that in the first proposition, namely,
that the brain is the exclusive seat of the understanding,
there is nothing new. Gall himself
admits this to be the case.</p>

<p>“For a long time,” says he, “both philosophers
and physiologists, as well as physicians,
have contended that the brain is the organ
of the soul.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The opinion that the brain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
(as a whole, or such and such parts of the
brain considered separately,) is the seat of
the soul, is, in fact, as old as learning itself.
Descartes placed the soul in the <i>pineal gland</i>,
Willis in the <i>corpora striata</i>, Lapeyronie in
the <i>corpus callosum</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>As to the more recent authorities, Gall quotes
Sœmmerring, who says precisely that, “the
brain is the exclusive instrument of all sensation,
all thought, and all will,”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> &amp;c. He quotes
Haller, who proves (proves is the very expression
made use of by Gall himself,) that “sensation
does not take place at the point where
the object touches the nerve, the point where
the impression is made, but in the brain.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
He might have quoted many other authorities
to the same effect.</p>

<p>Were not Cabanis’s writings anterior to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
time of Gall? and did not he say, “In order
to obtain a just idea of those operations whose
result is thought, the brain must be considered
as a peculiar organ designed to produce it, just
as the stomach and the bowels are designed
to produce digestion, the liver to secrete the
bile,” &amp;c.?<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> a proposition so extravagant as
to become almost ridiculous, but which is in
truth the very proposition of Gall himself,
except as to some exaggeration in the terms
employed.</p>

<p>Antecedently to the time of Gall, both
Sœmmerring and Cuvier, in the comparative
anatomy of the various classes of animals,
had investigated the ratio existing between
the development of the encephalon and that
of the intellectual power. The following remarkable
phrase is from the pen of Cuvier:
“The proportion of the brain to the medulla<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
oblongata, a proportion which is greater in
man than in all other animals, is a very good
index of the perfection of the creature’s intelligence,
because it is the best index of the preeminence
of the organs of reflection above the
organs of the external senses.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> And this
other still more remarkable phrase: “In animals
the intelligence appears to be greater in
proportion as the volume of the hemispheres
is greater.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Gall, in an especial manner, contends against
the assertion of Bichat, who remarks that “The
influence of the passions is exerted invariably
upon the organic life, and not upon the animal
life; all the signs that characterise them are
referable to the former and not to the latter.
Gestures, which are the mute exponents of the
sentiments and the understanding, afford a remarkable
proof of this truth. When we wish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
to signify something relative to the memory,
the imagination, to our perception, to the
judgment, &amp;c. the hand moves involuntarily
towards the head: if we wish to express love,
joy, grief, hatred, it is directed towards the region
of the heart, the stomach, or the bowels.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless, there is much that might be criticised
in the foregoing words of Bichat; nevertheless,
to say that the passions expend their
influences upon the organic life, is not the same
thing as to say that they reside or exist there.
Bichat had already remarked, that “Every
species of sensation has its centre in the brain,
for sensation always supposes both impression
and perception.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Furthermore, regarding this
distinction, (which as yet has not been drawn
with sufficient clearness,) between the parts
that are the seats of the passions, and the parts
that are affected by their action, Gall might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
have found in Descartes the following remark,
which is not less judicious than acute.</p>

<p>“Although,” says he, writing to Leroy, “the
spirits that move the muscles come from the
brain, we must, nevertheless, assign as seats of
the passions, the places that are most considerably
affected by them; hence, I say, the principal
seat of the passions, as far as they relate
to the body, is the heart, because it is the heart
that is most sensibly affected by them; but
their place is in the brain, in as far as they
affect the soul, for the soul cannot suffer immediately,
otherwise than through the brain.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>As I am quoting Descartes, who, I ask, more
clearly than Descartes has perceived that the
soul can have only a very circumscribed seat
in the economy, and that that circumscribed
seat is the brain itself?</p>

<p>“We know,” says he, “that, properly speaking,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
it is not inasmuch as the soul is in the
members that serve as organs to the exterior
senses, that the soul feels, but inasmuch as she
is in the brain, where she exercises the faculty
denominated common sense.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>He elsewhere observes: “Surprise is expressed
because I do not recognise any other
point of sensation except that which exists in
the brain; but all physicians and surgeons
will, I hope, assist me in proving this point,
for they are aware of the common fact that a
person who has been subjected to amputation
of a limb, continues to feel pain in a part that
he no longer possesses.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Here then, according to Descartes, we find
that the soul is situated, that is to say, <i>feels</i> in
the brain, and only in the brain. The following
passage shows with what precision he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
excluded even the external senses from any
participation with the functions of the soul.</p>

<p>“I have shown,” says he, “that size, distance,
and form are perceived only by the
reason; and that, by deducing them the one
from the other.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>“I cannot agree with the assertion that this
error (the error caused by the bent appearance
of a stick partly plunged into water,) is
not corrected by the understanding but by the
touch; for, although the sense in question
makes us judge that the stick is straight, yet
that cannot correct the error of vision; but
furthermore, it is requisite that reason should
teach us to confide, in this case, rather to our
judgment after touching, than to the judgment
that we come to after using our eyes; but this
reason cannot be attributed to the sense, but
to the understanding alone; and in this very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
example, it is the understanding that corrects
the error of the sense.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The brain, then, is the exclusive seat of the
soul; and all sensation, even those operations
that appear to depend upon the simple external
sense, is function of the soul.</p>

<p>Gall falls back upon Condillac, who, much
less rigorous in this particular than Descartes,
says, that “all our faculties proceed from
the senses.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> But when Condillac speaks
thus, he evidently speaks by ellipsis, for he
immediately adds these words: “The senses
are only occasional causes. They do not feel;
it is the soul that alone feels, through the
medium of the organs.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Now, if it be the <i>soul</i> only that feels, <i>à<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
fortiori</i>, it is the soul only that <i>remembers</i>, that
<i>judges</i>, that <i>imagines</i>, &amp;c. <i>Memory</i>, <i>judgment</i>,
<i>imagination</i>, &amp;c., in a word, all our
faculties, are therefore of the soul, and therefore
come from the soul, and not from the senses.</p>

<p>There is no philosopher who has exaggerated
more than Helvetius the influence of the
senses upon the intelligence. But Helvetius
says, “In whatsoever manner we interrogate
experience, she always answers that any
greater or lesser superiority of mind is independent
of any greater or lesser perfection of
the senses.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>But I leave Helvetius and Condillac, and I
return to Descartes, to Willis, to Lapeyronie,
to Haller, Sœmmerring, Cuvier, &amp;c. They
all perceived and all asserted that the brain
is the seat of the soul, and that it is so to
the exclusion of the senses. Therefore, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
proposition that the brain is the exclusive seat
of the soul is not a new proposition, and hence
does not originate with Gall. It belonged to
science before it appeared in his Doctrine.
The merit of Gall, and it is by no means a
slender merit, consists in his having understood
better than any of his predecessors the whole
of its importance, and in having devoted himself
to its demonstration. It existed in science
before Gall appeared—it may be said to reign
there ever since his appearance. Taking each
particular sense, he excluded them all, one
after another, from all immediate participation
in the functions of the understanding.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Far
from being developed in the direct ratio of the
intellection, most of them are developed in an
inverse ratio. Taste and smell are more developed
in the quadruped than in man. Sight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
and hearing are more so in the bird than in the
quadruped. The brain alone is in all classes
developed in the ratio of the understanding.
The loss of a sense does not lead to the loss of
the intelligence. The understanding survives
the loss of sight and hearing. It might survive
the loss of all the senses. To interrupt the
communication between the sense and the
brain, is enough to insure the loss of the
sense. The mere compression of the brain,
which abolishes the intellection, abolishes all
the senses. Far, therefore, from being organs
of the intelligence, the organs of the senses are
not even organs of the senses, they do not even
exercise their functions as organs of the senses,
except through the medium of the intelligence,
and this intelligence resides only in the brain.</p>

<p>The brain alone, therefore, is the organ of
the soul;—is it the whole brain—the brain
taken <i>en masse</i>? Gall thought so, and Spurzheim
followed Gall’s opinion; and all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
phrenologists who have come after them have
followed the examples of Gall and Spurzheim.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, it amounts to nothing. If we
deprive an animal of its cerebellum, it loses
only its locomotive action. If we deprive it of
its tubercula quadrigemina, it loses its sight
only; if we destroy its medulla oblongata, it
loses its respiratory movements, and in consequence
thereof, its life.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Neither of these parts,
therefore, that is to say, the cerebellum, the
tubercula quadrigemina, and the medulla oblongata,
is the organ of the understanding.</p>

<p>The brain, properly so called, is so, and it
alone. If we remove from an animal the
brain, properly so called, or the hemispheres,
it immediately loses its understanding, and
loses nothing but its understanding.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The brain, en masse, the <i>encephalon</i>, is then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
a multiple organ; and this multiple organ consists
of four particular organs: the cerebellum,
the seat of the principle that regulates the
movements of locomotion; the tubercula quadrigemina,
seats of the principle that regulates
the sense of sight; the medulla oblongata, in
which resides the principle that determines the
respiratory motions; and the brain proper, the
seat, and the exclusive seat of the intelligence.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Therefore, when the phrenologists promiscuously
place the intellectual and moral faculties
in the brain, considered en masse, they
deceive themselves. Neither the cerebellum,
the quadrigeminal tubercles, nor the medulla
oblongata can be regarded as seats of these
faculties. All these faculties dwell solely in the
brain, properly so called, or the hemispheres.</p>

<p>The question as to the precise seat of the
intelligence, has undergone a great change<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
since the time of Gall. Gall believed that the
intelligence was seated indifferently in the
whole encephalon, and it has been proved that
it resides only in the hemispheres.</p>

<p>Further, it is not the encephalon taken en
masse that is developed in the ratio of the intelligence
of the creature, but the hemispheres.
The mammifera are the animals most highly
endowed with intelligence; they have, other
things being equal, the most voluminous hemispheres.
Birds are the animals most highly
endowed with power of motion; their cerebellum
is, other things being equal, the largest.
Reptiles are the most torpid and apathetic of
animals; they have the smallest brain, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Every thing concurs then to prove, that the
encephalon, in mass, is a multiple organ with
multiple functions, consisting of different parts,
of which some are destined to subserve the
locomotive motions, others the motions of the
respiration, &amp;c., while one single one, the brain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
proper, is designed for the purposes of the
intellection.</p>

<p>This being conceded, it is evident that the
entire brain cannot be divided, as the phrenologists
divide it, into a number of small organs,
each of which is the seat of a distinct intellectual
faculty; for the entire brain does not serve
the purposes of what is called the intelligence.
The hemispheres alone are the seats of the
intellectual power; and consequently, the question
as to whether the organ, the seat of the
intelligence may be divided into several distinct
organs, is a question relative solely to the uses
and powers of the hemispheres.</p>

<p>Gall avers, and this is the second fundamental
proposition of his doctrine, that the
brain is divided into several organs, each one
of which lodges a particular faculty of the
soul. By the word <i>brain</i>, he understood the
<i>whole brain</i>, and he thus deceived himself.
Let us reduce the application of his proposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
to the hemispheres alone, and we shall see
that he has deceived himself again.</p>

<p>It has been shown by my late experiments,
that we may cut away, either in front, or
behind, or above, or on one side, a very
considerable slice of the hemisphere of the
brain, without destroying the intelligence.
Hence it appears, that quite a restricted
portion of the hemispheres may suffice for
the purposes of intellection in an animal.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, in proportion as these
reductions by slicing away the hemispheres
are continued, the intelligence becomes enfeebled,
and grows gradually less; and certain
limits being passed, is wholly extinguished.
Hence it appears, that the cerebral hemispheres
concur, by their whole mass, in the
full and entire exercise of the intelligence.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>In fine, as soon as one sensation is lost, all
sensation is lost; when one faculty disappears,
all the faculties disappear. There are not,
therefore, different seats for the different faculties,
nor for the different sensations. The
faculty of feeling, of judging, of willing any
thing, resides in the same place as the faculty
of feeling, judging, or willing any other thing,
and consequently this faculty, essentially a
unit, resides essentially in a single organ.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The understanding is, therefore, a unit.</p>

<p>According to Gall, there are as many particular
kinds of intellect as there are distinct
faculties of the mind. According to him, each
faculty has its perception, its memory, its
judgment, will, &amp;c., that is to say, all the
attributes of the understanding, properly so
called.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>“All the intellectual faculties,” says he, “are
endowed with the perceptive faculty, with
attention, recollection, memory, judgment, and
imagination.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Thus each faculty perceives, remembers,
judges, imagines, compares, creates; but these
are trifles—for each faculty <i>reasons</i>. “Whenever,”
says Gall, “a faculty compares and
judges of the relations of analogous or different
ideas, there is an act of comparison, there is an
act of judgment: a sequence of comparisons
and judgments constitutes reasoning,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Therefore, each and every faculty is an
understanding by itself, and Gall says so expressly.
“There are,” says he, “as many
different kinds of intellect or understanding as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
there are distinct faculties.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> “Each distinct
faculty,” says he, further, “is intellect or
understanding—each <i>individual intelligence</i>
(the words are precise) has its proper organ.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>But, admitting all these <i>kinds of intellects</i>,
all these <i>individual understandings</i>, where
are we to seek for the General Intelligence, the
understanding, properly so called? It must,
as you may please, be either an <i>attribute</i> of
each faculty,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> or the <i>collective expression</i> of
all the faculties, or even the mere simple <i>result</i>
of their common and simultaneous action;<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> in
one word, it cannot be that positive and single
faculty which we understand, conceive of, and
feel in ourselves, when we pronounce the
word <i>soul</i> or <i>understanding</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>Now here is the sum and the substance
of Gall’s psycology. For the understanding,
essentially a unit faculty, he substitutes a
multitude of little understandings or faculties,
distinct and isolate. And, as these faculties,
which perform just as he wills them to do—which
he multiplies according to his pleasure,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
seem in his eyes to explain certain phenomena
which are not well explained by the lights of
ordinary philosophy, he triumphs!</p>

<p>He does not perceive that an explanation,
which is words merely, adapts itself to any
and to every thing. In the time of Malebranche,
every thing was explained by <i>animal
spirits</i>; Barthez explained every thing by his
<i>vital principle</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“This,” says Gall, “explains how the same
man may possess a judgment that is ready and
sure as to certain objects, while it is imbecile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
as to certain others; how he may have the
liveliest and most fruitful imagination upon
some subjects, while it is cold and sterile upon
others.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>“Grant,” says he, further, “to the animals
certain fundamental faculties, and you have
the dog that follows the chase with <i>passion</i>;
the weasel that strangles the poultry with
<i>rage</i>; the nightingale that sings with <i>fervour</i>
beside his mate,”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> &amp;c.</p>

<p>No doubt of it. But what sort of philosophy
is that, that thinks to explain a fact by a
word? You observe such or such a penchant
in an animal, such or such a taste or talent in
a man; <i>presto</i>, a particular faculty is produced
for each one of these peculiarities, and you
suppose the whole matter to be settled. You
deceive yourself; your <i>faculty</i> is only a <i>word</i>,—it
is the name of the fact,—and all the difficulty
remains just where it was before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>Besides, you speak only of the facts that you
suppose yourself able to explain; you say
nothing of those that you render by your
system wholly inexplicable. You say not one
word as to the unity of the understanding, the
unity of the <i>me</i>, or you deny it. But the
unity of the understanding, the unity of the
<i>me</i>, is a fact of the conscious sense, and
the conscious sense is more powerful than all
the philosophies together.</p>

<p>Gall is always talking about observation,
and he was indeed, as an observer, full of
ingenuity. But, in order to follow out an
observation, it must be traced to the very
end, and we must accept all that it yields to
our research; and observation every where
gives, and shows every where, and above all
things else, the unity of the understanding, the
unity of the <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>Gall’s philosophy consists only in transmuting
into a particular understanding each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
separate <i>mode</i><a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of the understanding, properly
so called.</p>

<p>Descartes had already said, “There are in
us as many faculties as there are truths to be
known.... But I do not think that any useful
application can be made of this way of thinking;
and it seems to me rather more likely to
be mischievous, by giving to the ignorant
occasion for imagining an equal number of
little entities in the soul.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>It may well be supposed that Gall, who in
the word understanding sees nothing but an
abstract word, expressive of the sum of our
intellectual faculties, would also, in the word
<i>will</i>, perceive nothing more than an abstract
word, expressing the sum of our moral
faculties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>He had given a definition of <i>reason</i>: “The
result of the simultaneous action of all the
intellectual faculties.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> In the same way he
defined <i>will</i> to be “the result of the simultaneous
action of the superior intellectual faculties.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
But Gall always deceives himself; for
reason and will are not <i>results</i>—they are
<i>powers</i>, and primary powers of thought.</p>

<p>Gall, in a manner equally singular, defines
<i>moral liberty</i> or <i>free will</i>.</p>

<p>“Moral liberty,” says he, “is nothing more
than the faculty of <i>being determined</i>, and of
determining under motive.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Not so: liberty
is precisely the power to determine against all
motive. Locke well defined liberty as <i>power</i>:
to be determined, is to allow one’s self to be
determined—that is, to <i>obey</i>.</p>

<p>Gall says again, “Unlimited liberty supposes
not only that man governs himself independently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
of all law, but that he is the creator of
his own nature.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Not at all; it supposes
that he may have choice—and in fact he does
choose.</p>

<p>Lastly, Gall says, “A phenomenon such
as that of absolute liberty, would be a phenomenon
occurring without any cause whatever.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Why without cause? The cause
is in the power of choosing—and this power
is a fact.</p>

<p>Gall’s whole doctrine is one series of errors,
which press upon each other cumulatively.
He resolves that the part of the brain in which
the understanding resides shall be divided into
many small organs, distinct from each other;
a physiological error. He decries the unity of
the understanding, and looks upon the will
and the reason as mere results—psycological
errors. In the free will he perceives merely a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
compulsory determination,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and consequently
a mere result—this is a moral error.</p>

<p>Man’s liberty is a positive faculty, and not
the simple passive result of the preponderance
of one <i>motive</i> over another <i>motive</i>, of one
<i>organ</i> over another <i>organ</i>.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Reason, will, liberty, are therefore, not as
in Gall’s doctrine, <i>positive faculties</i>, <i>active
powers</i>; or rather, they are the understanding
itself. Reason, will, liberty, are in fact
the understanding, as <i>conceiving</i>, <i>willing</i>,
<i>choosing</i>, or <i>deliberating</i>.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The consciousness which feels itself to be
one, feels itself free. And you will remark,
that these two great facts given out by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
inward sense, the consciousness, to wit, the
unity of the understanding and the positive
power of the free will, are precisely the two
first facts denied by the philosophy of Gall.</p>

<p>And take good care to observe further, that
if there be in us any thing that belongs to
the <i>consciousness</i>, it is evidently and par
excellence the sense of our personal unity;
or what is more, the consciousness of our
moral liberty.</p>

<p>Man is a moral force, only inasmuch as he
is a free force. Any philosophy that attempts
the liberty of man, attempts, without knowing
it, morals itself. Man then is free, and as he
is a moral agent only in proportion as he is
free, it would seem that his liberty is the only
attribute of his soul from which Providence
has designed to remove all the boundaries.</p>

<p>“What is here very remarkable,” says
Descartes, “is that, of all within me, there is
not one thing so perfect or so great, but that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
I know it might be greater and more perfect.
Thus, for example, if I consider my faculty of
conceiving, I find it of very small extent, and
very limited. If, in the same manner, I examine
the memory, the imagination, or any
other one of my faculties, I find not one that is
not very limited and very small. Within me
there is only my will or my liberty of free
will, which I feel to be so great that I conceive
not the idea of another more full and of
greater extent.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II.<br />
OF GALL.<br />
<span class="smaller">OF THE FACULTIES.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Gall’s philosophy consists wholly in the
substitution of <i>multiplicity</i> for <i>unity</i>. In
place of one general and single brain,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> he
substitutes a number of small brains: instead
of one general sole understanding, he substitutes
several individual understandings.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
These pretended <i>individual understandings</i>
are the <i>faculties</i>.</p>

<p>Now, Gall admits the existence of twenty-seven
of these faculties, each one of them
(since each one is a peculiar understanding)
endowed with its perceptive faculty, its memory,
its judgment, its imagination; &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Hence, there are twenty-seven perceptive
faculties, twenty-seven memories, twenty-seven
judgments, twenty-seven imaginations, &amp;c.</p>

<p>For, if we are to follow Gall, each attribute
is not less distinct than each faculty. The
memory, the judgment, imagination, &amp;c. of
one faculty are not the memory, judgment,
or imagination of another faculty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>“The sense of numbers,” says he, “possesses
a judgment for the relations of numbers;
the sense of the arts, a judgment for
works of art; but where the fundamental
faculty is wanting, the judgment relative to
objects of that faculty must necessarily be
wanting likewise.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>He says further: “It is impossible for an
individual to possess imagination and judgment
for any object with the fundamental faculty
for which he has not been gifted by nature.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Thus, beyond all doubt: there are twenty-seven
faculties; and as there are twenty-seven
faculties, there must be twenty-seven memories,
judgments, imaginations, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In one word, there is no such thing as a
general understanding; but there are twenty-seven
special understandings, with three or
four times twenty-seven distinct attributes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
of each. Such is the entire psycology of
Gall.</p>

<p>To proceed. Gall’s twenty-seven faculties
are: the instinct of propagation, love of offspring,
self-defence, the carnivorous instinct,
the sense of property, friendship, cunning,
pride, vanity, circumspection, memory for
things, memory for words, sense of locality,
sense of persons, sense of language, of relations
of colours, relations of sounds, relations
of numbers, of mechanics, of comparative
sagacity, the metaphysical genius, sarcasm,
poetic talent, benevolence, imitation, religion,
firmness.</p>

<p>Gall says that these faculties are innate,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
and this assertion certainly will not be contested.</p>

<p>Locke, who so vigorously opposed the doctrine
of innate ideas, never decried the <i>innateness</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
of our faculties. He always regarded
them as natural, that is to say, <i>innate</i>.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Condillac himself, who charges Locke with
having considered the faculties of the soul as
<i>innate</i>, in making these charges confounds the
<i>faculties of the soul</i> with the <i>operations of
the soul</i>.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Now, that which is perfectly true as to the
<i>operations of the soul</i>, is by no means so as
regards her <i>faculties</i>. All the faculties of the
soul are innate and contemporary, for they are
nothing more than <i>modes</i> of the soul; indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
they are the soul itself, viewed under different
aspects. But the operations of the soul succeed
each other, and beget each other. There
can be no memory without previous perception;
there can be no judgment without recollection.
In order that there may be a will,
there must have been a judgment, &amp;c.</p>

<p>After saying that the faculties are innate,
Gall says also that they are <i>independent</i>.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>And if, by the word <i>independent</i>, he means
distinct, there is nothing less contestible. But
if, by this word <i>independent</i>, he understood
(as indeed he does understand) that each
faculty is a real understanding, the question
is altered and the difficulty begins.</p>

<p>For, if each individual faculty is a proper
understanding, it follows that there are as
many understandings as there are faculties,
and the understanding ceases to be <i>one</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the <i>me</i> is no longer <i>one</i>. I am well aware
that this is exactly what Gall means; he says
it, and reiterates it throughout his work. He
says it, but does not prove it. And how
should he prove it? Can we prove any thing
against our consciousness?</p>

<p>“I remark here, in the first place,” says
Descartes, “that there is a great difference
between the mind and the body, in that the
body is, by its nature, always divisible, and
the mind wholly indivisible. For, in fact,
when I contemplate it—that is, when I contemplate
my own self—and consider myself as a
thing that thinks, I cannot discover in myself
any parts, but I clearly know and conceive that
I am a thing absolutely one and complete.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Gall reverses the common philosophy, and
it is worthy of remark, that the whole of his
philosophy, which he thinks so novel,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> is, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
the very letter, nothing more nor less than
this very inversion. According to common
philosophy, there is one general understanding—a
unit; and there are faculties which are
but modes of this understanding. Gall asserts
that there are as many kinds of peculiar intelligences
as there are faculties, and that the
understanding in general is nothing more than
a mode or attribute of each faculty. He says
so expressly.</p>

<p>His words are: “The intellectual faculty and
all its subdivisions, such as perception, recollection,
memory, judgment, and imagination, are
not fundamental faculties, but merely their
general attributes.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Gall first inverts the common philosophy,
and then contends for the existence of all the
consequences of that common philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>He suppresses the <i>me</i>, but insists that there
is a soul. He abolishes the freewill, and yet
contends that there is such a thing as morals.
He makes of the idea of God an idea that is
merely relative and conditional, but yet asserts
that there may be such a thing as religion.</p>

<p>I say he abolishes the <i>me</i>; for the <i>me</i> is the
soul. The soul is the understanding, general
and one; but if there be no understanding as
general, there can be no soul.</p>

<p>According to Gall, there is nothing real and
positive except the <i>faculties</i>.</p>

<p>And these faculties alone are possessed of
organs. “None of my predecessors,” says he,
“had any knowledge of those forces which
alone are the functions of special cerebral
organs.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>By the contrary reasoning, neither the will,
nor the reason, nor the understanding, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
possessed of any organs, for they are nothing
but forces; they are nothing but nouns collective—words.</p>

<p>“These observations may suffice,” says Gall,
“to convince the reader that there cannot exist
any special organ of the will, or the freewill.”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
He adds: “It is equally impossible that there
should be any peculiar organ of the reason.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Finally he says: “From all that I have now
said it follows, that the idea of an organ of
the intellect or understanding is quite as inadmissible
as the idea of an organ of the
instinct.”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Hence there can be nought but the faculties;
and, according to Gall, these faculties are so
distinct, that he attributes to each particular
one a separate organ.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> He divides the understanding
into little understandings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>Descartes expressed himself in the following
words: “We do not conceive of any body,
except as divisible; whereas the human mind
cannot conceive of itself except as indivisible;
for in fact we are incapable of conceiving of
half a soul.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Gall, however, settles that
point. He makes half souls. He retrenches
or adds as many faculties as suits his plan.
These faculties are separated by material
limits. He goes so far as to say that such
or such a faculty acts with greater or less
facility upon such or such another faculty,
according as one happens to be situated nearer
to or farther off from the other.</p>

<p>“As the organ of the arts,” says he, “is
located far from that of the sense of colour,
the circumstance explains why historical
painters have rarely been colourists.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Thus, we find that the faculties alone are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
possessed of <i>forces</i>. These forces alone are
endowed with organs; and these organs, by
which they are kept separate from each other,
separate them to distances sufficiently great to
hinder, in certain cases, one given faculty from
exercising any influence over another. Therefore,
there is no such thing as unity; there is
no unit faculty, no unit understanding; there
is no <i>me</i>; and if there be no <i>me</i>, there can be
no soul.</p>

<p>In the same way he abolishes the <i>freewill</i>.
Will, liberty, reason, in his view,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
are nothing but <i>results</i>, as I have already
stated.</p>

<p>“To the end,” says he, “that man may not
be confined merely to the ability to wish—in
order that he may actually will—the concurrence
of several superior faculties is requisite.
The motives must be weighed, compared, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
judged; the decision resulting from this operation
is denominated will.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>“Reason,” he further adds, “supposes a
concerted action of the superior faculties. It
is the judgment pronounced by the superior
intellectual faculties.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Hence, the will is nothing but a <i>decision</i>;
reason is nothing but a <i>judgment</i>. The faculties
<i>concert together</i>. What a singular philosophy,
which always substitutes the fictions
of language for the facts of the conscious sense,
and which is satisfied with those fictions!</p>

<p>Freewill is either a power, a force, or it is
nothing. He resolves that it is merely a <i>result</i>.
Gall therefore abolishes the freewill.</p>

<p>Indeed, he makes of the idea of God nothing
but a relative and conditional idea, for he supposes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
that this idea comes from a particular
organ; and he supposes that that organ may
possibly, in some case, be wanting.</p>

<p>“It cannot be doubted,” says Gall, “that
the human race are endowed with an organ
by means of which it recognises and admires
the Author of the universe.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>“God exists,” adds he, “for there is an
organ to know and adore him.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>But he continues: “Climate and other circumstances
may obstruct the development of
the cerebral part, by means of which the
Creator designed to reveal himself to his creature
man.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Again: “If there were a people whose
organization should be altogether defective in
this respect, they would be as little susceptible
as any other kinds of animal, of the religious
idea or sentiment.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>Further: “There is no God for beings whose
organization does not bear the original stamp
of determinate faculties.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>What! If I happen not to possess a little
peculiar organ, (for it may be wanting,) can I
not feel that God exists! And how can I be
an intelligence, knowing myself, and yet not
knowing that God is? I do not more strongly
feel that I am, than that God is. “This idea,”
(the idea of God) says Descartes, “is born and
produced along with me, just as is the idea of
myself.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>My understanding, which perceives itself
and feels itself to be an effect, necessarily perceives
the intelligent Cause which produced
it. “It is a very evident thing,” says Descartes
again, “that there must be at least as
much reality in a cause as in the effect it
produces; and since I am a thing that thinks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
whatsoever be in fact the cause of my being,
I am compelled to confess, that <i>it also</i> is
something that thinks.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Hitherto I have considered Gall’s philosophy
only under its speculative points of view;
what would it be, if considered in a practical
relation?</p>

<p>In one of his happy moments, Diderot wrote
the following very remarkable phrase: “The
ruin of liberty overthrows all order and all
government, confounds vice and virtue together,
sanctions every monstrous infamy,
extinguishes all shame and all remorse, and
degrades and deforms without recovery the
whole human race.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Nothing astonishes a phrenologist.</p>

<p>“Let us imagine,” says Gall, “a woman in
whom the love of offspring is but little developed, ... if,
unfortunately, the organ of murder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
be very much developed in her, need we be
surprised if her hand....”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> &amp;c.</p>

<p>Organization explains every thing.</p>

<p>“These last named facts show us,” says
Gall, “that this detestable inclination (the
inclination to commit murder) has its source
in a vice of the organization.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>“Let those haughty men,” says he again,
“who cause nations to be slaughtered by thousands,
know that they do not act of their own
accord, but that Nature herself has filled their
hearts with rage and destructiveness.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>No, indeed! This is not what they must
know; for, thanks be to God, it is not true.
What they ought to know, what they ought
to be told, is, that although Providence has
left to man the power to do evil, he has also
endowed him with the power to do good.
That which man ought to know, that which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
should be instilled into his mind and heart is,
that he has a free power, and that this power
ought not to be misdirected; and that he who
in his own nature misdirects it, no matter
under what form of philosophy he takes refuge,
is a being who degrades his nature.</p>

<p>Under the title of <i>fundamental faculties</i>,
Gall confounds all things together—the passions,
the instinct, the intellectual faculties.
These faculties, which are at the basis of his
whole philosophy, he knows not even how to
denominate them. He calls them instincts,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
inclinations, senses, memories, &amp;c. There is
a memory or sense of things, a memory or
sense of persons, &amp;c. He confounds the instinct
that leads certain animals to live in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
elevated regions with pride, which is a moral
sentiment in man;<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> the carnivorous instinct
with courage;<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> he believes that conscience,
(which is the soul judging itself,) is nothing
but a modification of a particular sense, the
sense of benevolence, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The hesitation of his mind is visible every
where.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>“I leave it to the reader,” says he, “to
decide whether the fundamental faculty to
which this penchant relates, should be denominated
sense of elevation, self-esteem,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>“To speak correctly,” continues he, “firmness
is neither a penchant nor a faculty; it is
a mode-of-being, which gives to a man a distinctive
quality, which is called character.”<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Finally, he writes the following paragraph,
perhaps the most singular one that he ever
wrote, for it shows in the clearest manner
how little confidence he had in his own
psycology.</p>

<p>“If we are materialists because we do not
admit the existence of a unit-faculty of the
soul, but recognise several primitive faculties,
we ask whether the ordinary division of the
faculties of the soul into understanding, will,
attention, memory, judgment, imagination, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
affections and passions, expresses nothing more
than a primitive unit-faculty? If it be asserted
that all these faculties are merely modifications
of a sole and same faculty, what can hinder
us from making the same assertion as to the
faculties whose existence we do admit.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>To be sure, nothing prevents you. Or
rather every thing constrains you to do so.
There is therefore one sole faculty, of which
all the other faculties are but moods. You
return then to the common philosophy, and
consequently you no longer possess a peculiar
philosophy.</p>

<p>The problem proposed by Gall is at the
same time physiological, psycological, and
anatomical.</p>

<p>In our first article an account has been
given of Gall’s <i>physiology</i>, and it has been
shown to be generally disproved by direct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
experiment. In the present one his <i>psycology</i>
has been examined, and it is confuted by the
consciousness (<i>le sens intime</i>). It only remains
for us now to examine his <i>anatomy</i>.</p>

OF GALL.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ORGANS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Of all Gall’s writings, his anatomy is that
which has been most talked of, and yet it is
the part least known.</p>

<p>In the year 1808, Gall read to the first class
of the Institute a memoir on the anatomy of
the brain;<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and M. Cuvier made a report upon
that memoir. But neither in that memoir nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
in the report do we find one word of <i>special
anatomy</i>, of <i>secret anatomy</i>, of what might
be called <i>anatomy of the Doctrine</i>; or, in
other terms, and as it would be expressed at
the present day, of <i>phrenological anatomy</i>.</p>

<p>The anatomy of Gall’s memoir is nothing
but a very ordinary anatomy. He insists that
the cerebral nerves, all of them without exception,
rise upwards from the medulla oblongata
towards the encephalon; that the cineritious
matter produces the white matter: he divides
the fibres of the brain into <i>divergent</i> and <i>convergent</i>;
he supposes that each convolution of
this organ, instead of being a full and solid
mass, as is generally thought, is merely a fold<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
of nervous or medullary fibres, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Such are the questions discussed by Gall;
and it is sufficiently clear that, whatever side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
we take upon these questions, his doctrine
assuredly would neither gain nor lose any
thing.</p>

<p>Whether such or such a nerve ascends or
descends; whether the white matter is produced
by the gray; or whether, which is, to
say the least, quite as probable, this be nonsense;
whether this or that fibre goes out or
comes in, diverges or converges, &amp;c. &amp;c. the
doctrine of the plurality of brains, the doctrine
of individual intelligences, will be neither
more nor less true, more nor less doubtful.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>M. Cuvier, in his report, observed: “It is
essential to repeat, were it merely for the
information of the public, that the anatomical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
questions we have been considering, have no
immediate and necessary connexion with the
physiological doctrines taught by M. Gall, as
to the functions and relative volume of different
parts of the brain; and that all that we
have inquired into as to the structure of the
brain, might be either true or false, without
affording the least conclusion in favour of or
against the doctrine.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>It is necessary not to make any mistake
as to the real point of the question. Gall’s
doctrine goes to establish one and only one
thing, to wit, <i>the plurality of intelligences</i>
and <i>the plurality of brains</i>.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> That is what
constitutes the special and peculiar doctrine;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
that is to say, different from the common doctrine,
which admits but one understanding and
a single brain. Whatever goes to prove the
plurality of understandings and brains belongs
to Gall’s doctrine; and whatever does not tend
to prove the plurality of understandings and
brains is in opposition to that doctrine.</p>

<p>Gall’s works then really contain two very
distinct anatomies: one is a <i>general anatomy</i>,
which has nothing in particular to do with
his doctrine; the other is a <i>special anatomy</i>,
which, supposing it to be true, would constitute
the basis of his doctrine.</p>

<p>Now, a great deal has been said about
Gall’s general anatomy; but as to his special
anatomy, I know of no one who has spoken
of it. Gall himself says as little as possible
about it. In other matters he tells his opinions
both very clearly and very positively: in this
particular we are obliged to guess at them.</p>

<p>When Gall, in his <i>psycology</i>, substitutes the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
<i>faculties</i> for the understanding, he defines
those <i>faculties</i>. He defines them, as we
have already seen, to be <i>individual intelligences</i>.
How happens it, then, that in his
anatomy, when he substitutes the organs of
the brain for the brain itself, he does not
define these organs? How strange! Gall’s
whole doctrine, all <i>phrenology</i>, rests upon the
<i>organs of the brain</i>; for, without distinct
cerebral organs, there can be no independent
faculties; and without independent faculties
there can be no phrenology: and Gall does
not say, nor has any phrenologist said for
him, what is the thing called a <i>cerebral
organ</i>.</p>

<p>The truth is: Gall never had any settled
opinion upon what he called the organs of the
brain; he never saw those <i>organs</i>, and he
imagined them for the use of his <i>faculties</i>.
He did what so many others have done. He
commenced with imagining a hypothesis, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
then he imagined an anatomy to suit his
hypothesis.</p>

<p>When the doctrine of animal spirits was
believed, the brain was composed of pipes
and tubes to convey these spirits.</p>

<p>“The cortical substance which is found in
the hemispheres of the brain,” says Pourfour
du Petit, “furnishes the whole of the medullary
portion, which is a mere collection of an
infinite number of pipes.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>“The small arteries of the cortical part of
the brain,” says Haller, “transmit a spirituous
liquor into the medullary and nervous tubes.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that the <i>organs</i> of Gall have
no more real existence than the <i>pipes</i> of Pourfour
du Petit, or the <i>tubes</i> of Haller. They
are two structures that have been imagined,
as suitable for two hypotheses.</p>

<p>In searching for the primary idea, the secret<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
notion that led Gall to his doctrine of the
<i>plurality of the intelligences</i>, I detect it in
the analogy that he supposed to exist between
the functions of the senses and the faculties of
the soul.</p>

<p>He sees the functions of the senses constituting
distinct functions, and insists that the
faculties of the soul must constitute equally
distinct faculties; he sees each particular sense
possessing an organ proper to itself, and thinks
that each faculty of the soul must have its
proper organ;<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> in one word, he looks upon
the outer man, and constructs the inner man
after the image of the outer man.</p>

<p>According to Gall, every thing between an
organ of a sense and an organ of a faculty,
between a faculty and sense, is similar. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
faculty is a sense. His words are: the <i>memory
or the sense of things</i>, the <i>memory or the
sense of persons</i>, the <i>memory or the sense
of numbers</i>. He talks of the <i>sense of language</i>,
the <i>sense of mechanics</i>, the <i>sense of
the relations of colours</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>“As we must admit,” says he, “five different
external senses, since their functions
are essentially different, ... so we must
agree, after all, to acknowledge the different
faculties and the different inclinations as being
essentially different moral and intellectual
forces, and likewise connected with organic
apparatuses, which are special to each and
independent of each other.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>“Who,” says he, “can dare to say that
sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch, are
simple modifications of faculties? Who could
dare to derive them from a single and same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
source, from a single and same organ? In
the same way, the twenty-seven qualities and
faculties which I recognise as fundamental or
primary forces, ... cannot be regarded as the
simple modifications of any one faculty.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>On the one hand, Gall gives to the <i>faculties</i>
all the independence of the <i>senses</i>; and on the
other, he gives the <i>senses</i> all the attributes of
the <i>faculties</i>.</p>

<p>“Here,” says he, “are new reasons why
I have always maintained in my public
discourses, though these assertions are in
opposition to the ideas that prevail among
philosophers, that each organ of a sense possesses
absolutely its own functions; that each
of these organs has its peculiar faculty of
receiving and even of perceiving impressions,
its own conscience, its own faculty of reminiscence,”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
&amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>Gall did not foresee that a physiological
experiment (and a very sure one it is) would
one day demonstrate that the sense receives
the impression but does not perceive it, and
that, consequently, it is endowed neither with
<i>conscience</i> nor <i>reminiscence</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When the cerebral lobes or hemispheres<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
are removed from an animal, the animal immediately
loses its sight.</p>

<p>And yet nothing, as regards the eyes themselves,
has been changed; objects continue to
be depicted upon the retina, the iris retains its
contractility, and the optic nerve its excitability.
The retina continues to be sensible of
light, for the iris contracts or dilates according
as the light admitted to it is more or less
intense.</p>

<p>No change has taken place as to the structure
of the eye, and yet the animal does not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
see! Therefore it is not the eye that perceives,
nor is it the eye that sees.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The eye does not see; it is the understanding
that sees by means of the eyes.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>When Gall concludes from the independence
of the external senses to the independence of
the faculties of the soul, he confounds, as to
the sense itself, two things that are essentially
distinct, impression and perception. Impression
is multiple; perception is single.</p>

<p>When the hemispheres are removed, the
animal instantly loses its perception; it no
longer sees nor hears,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> &amp;c. notwithstanding
all the organs of the senses, the eye, the ear,
&amp;c. subsist, and the impressions take place.</p>

<p>Therefore the principle that perceives is <i>one</i>.
Lost for one sense, it is lost for all the senses.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
And if it be <i>one</i> for the external senses, how
can it be other than <i>one</i> for the faculties of
the soul?</p>

<p>Gall therefore cannot suppose the existence
of several distinct principles for the faculties of
the soul, otherwise than because he supposes
several distinct principles for the perceptions;
and he only supposes several principles for the
perceptions because he confounds impression
with perception. The whole of his psycology
arises from a mistake; and the whole of his
anatomy is constructed for the sake of his
psycology.</p>

<p>In psycology he endeavours to prove that
the faculties of the soul are merely <i>internal
senses</i>; in anatomy, he endeavours to prove
that the organs of the faculties of the soul
only repeat and reproduce the organs of the
<i>external senses</i>.</p>

<p>Now an <i>organ</i>, that is to say, under the
present point of view, the <i>nerve</i> of an <i>external<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
sense</i>, is nothing more than a <i>fascicle</i> of
<i>nervous fibres</i>. Therefore the brain, under
the theory, can be nothing but a collection
of <i>fascicles</i> of <i>fibres</i>.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>According to Gall, the origin, the development,
the structure and mode of termination,
as to the organs of the faculties of the soul
and the organs of the external senses, every
thing is similar, every thing is in common.
And yet the primitive difficulty remains unsolved.</p>

<p>When I say an <i>organ of the senses</i>, I speak
of a very determinate nervous apparatus. But
is the same thing true when I say an organ of
the brain? What is an organ of the brain?
Is it a <i>fascicle</i> of <i>fibres</i>? Is it each particular
fibre? But if it be a <i>fascicle</i> of <i>fibres</i>, there
are too few of them, for there are not twenty-seven
of them; and twenty-seven are necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
for there are twenty-seven faculties. If
it be each particular fibre, then there are too
many of them, and far too many, because
there are only twenty-seven faculties. What
are we to do in this difficulty? We must do
as Gall does: sometimes say it is a fascicle
of fibres; at other times, that it is each fibre
in particular.</p>

<p>In one place he says: “The brain consisting
of several divisions whose functions are totally
different, there are several primary bundles,
which contribute by their development to produce
it. Among these bundles we place the
anterior and posterior pyramids, the bundles
that come off direct from the corpora olivaria,
and some others that are concealed in the
interior of the medulla oblongata.”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p><i>And there are yet some others</i>; be it so;
but they never can amount to twenty-seven.</p>

<p>Again he says: “A more extensive development
of the same conjecture, might perhaps
dispose the reader to consider each nervous
fibrilla, whether in the nerves or in the brain
itself, as a little special organ.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Even this is not all. For the sake of Gall’s
doctrine, the anatomy of the brain must have
a connexion with cranioscopy. And Gall
takes great care to place all his organs upon
the surface of the brain.</p>

<p>“The possibility of a solution of the problem
under consideration,” says he, “supposes
the organs of the soul to be situated at the
surface of the brain.”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Indeed, were they
not situated at the surface of the brain, how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
could the cranium bear the impression of
them? and what would become of cranioscopy?</p>

<p>Cranioscopy has nothing to fear. Gall has
made provision for it; all the organs of the
brain are placed at the surface of the brain;
and Gall most judiciously adds, “This explains
the relation or the correspondence that
exists between craniology and the doctrine of
the cerebral functions (cerebral physiology),
the sole aim and end of my researches.”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>But as to the pretended <i>organs of the brain</i>,
are they really situated at the surface of the
brain, as Gall asserts? In plain terms, is the
surface of the brain the only active part of
the organ? Here is a physiological experiment
that shows how very much mistaken
Gall is.</p>

<p>You can slice off a considerable portion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
an animal’s brain, either in front, behind, on
one side, or on the top, without his losing anyone
of his faculties.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The animal may, therefore, lose all that Gall
calls surface of the brain, without losing any
of his faculties. Therefore it cannot be that
the organs of the faculties reside at the <i>surface
of the brain</i>.</p>

<p>And comparative anatomy is not less opposite
to Gall’s opinions than is direct experiment
itself. I shall not follow him here in the
detail of his localizations. How could these
localizations have any meaning? He does
not even know whether an organ is a <i>fascicle
of fibres</i>, or a <i>fibre</i>.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>For example; he places what he calls the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
instinct of propagation in the cerebellum, and
what he calls the <i>instinct of the love of
offspring</i>, in the posterior cerebral lobes; and
he looks upon these two localizations as the
very surest in his book.</p>

<p>“I should wish,” says he, “that all young
naturalists might begin their researches with
the study of these two organs. They are both
easily to be recognised,”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> &amp;c.</p>

<p>What! The cerebellum, so different in its
structure from the great brain, is the cerebellum,
like the brain,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> to be considered an
organ of instinct? And what is more, is it to
be regarded as the organ of a single instinct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
only, while the brain shall have twenty-six of
them?</p>

<p>I have already said that the cerebellum is
the seat of the principle that presides over
the locomotion<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> of the animal, and that it is
not the seat of any instinct.</p>

<p>Gall places the love of offspring in the posterior
lobes of the brain.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Now, the love of
offspring, and especially maternal love, is
every where to be found among the superior
animals; it is found in all the mammifera,
in all the birds.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The posterior lobes of the
brain, therefore, ought to be found in all these
beings. Not at all: the posterior lobes are
wanting in most of the mammifera; they are
wanting in all the birds.</p>

<p>Gall locates the faculties that are common to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
both man and animals, in the posterior part
of the brain; in the anterior part he places
those<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> that are peculiar to man alone. According
to this plan, the most <i>persistent</i> portion of
the brain will be the posterior portion, and the
least persistent the anterior portion. But the
inverse of the proposition holds. The parts
that are most frequently wanting are the <i>posterior
parts</i>, and those that are most invariably
present are the <i>anterior parts</i>.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>If, from the brain, I pass on to consider the
cranium, all the foregoing is found to be of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
still greater force. How can the localizations
that are destitute of meaning as to the brain—how
can they, I say, have any meaning as
relative to the cranium itself?</p>

<p>The cranium, especially the external surface
of it, represents the superficial configuration
of the brain but very imperfectly. Gall knows
it. “I was the first,” says he, “to maintain
that it is impossible for us to determine with
exactitude the development of certain circumvolutions,
by the inspection of the external
surface of the cranium. In certain cases, the
exterior lamina of the cranium is not parallel
with the internal lamina.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> “There are certain
species in which there is no frontal
sinus; in others, the cells betwixt the two
bony laminæ are found throughout the whole
skull,”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>The cranium represents the convolutions of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
the brain only upon its inner surface; it does
not represent them upon its external superficies.
And as to the <i>fibres</i>, as to the <i>bundles
of fibres</i>, it does not even represent them on
its inner surface; for the fibres are covered
with a layer of gray matter, and the bundles
of fibres are situated in the interior of the
nervous mass.</p>

<p>Gall is aware of all this, and nevertheless
he inscribes his twenty-seven faculties upon
the skulls.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Such confidence surprises one.
Nothing is known of the intimate structure of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
the brain,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> and yet people are bold enough
to trace upon it their circumscriptions, their
circles, their boundaries. The external surface
of the skull does not represent the brain’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
surface, it is admitted; and yet they inscribe
upon this surface twenty-seven names, each of
which names is written within a small circle,
each little circle corresponding to one precise
faculty! And what is stranger yet, people
are to be found who, under each of these
names inscribed by Gall, imagine that there
is concealed something more than a name!</p>

<p>Those who, seeing the success of Gall’s doctrine,
imagine that the doctrine therefore rests
upon some solid foundation, know very little
of mankind. Gall knew mankind better. He
studied them in his own way, but he studied
them very closely. Let us hear his own words:</p>

<p>“In society, I employ many expedients to
find out the talents and inclinations of people.
I start the conversation upon a variety of
topics. In general, we let fall in conversation
whatsoever has little or no concern with our
faculties and penchants; but when the interlocutor
touches upon one of our favourite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
subjects, we at once become interested in it....
Do you wish to spy out the character of a
person, without the fear of being misled as to
your conclusions, even though he might be
on his guard? Set him to talking about his
childhood and boyhood; make him relate his
schoolboy exploits; his conduct towards his
parents, his brothers and sisters, and his playfellows,
and his emulators.... Ask him about
his games, &amp;c. Few persons think it necessary
to dissemble upon these points; they
do not suspect they are dealing with one
who knows perfectly well that the basis of
character remains ever the same; and that
the objects only that interest us change with
the progress of years.... Besides, when I
discover what it is that a person admires or
despises; when I see him act; when he is an
author, and I merely read his book, &amp;c. &amp;c.
the whole man stands unveiled before me.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>Descartes <i>shut himself up in a stove</i>,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> in
order that he might meditate. According to
Gall, there is no necessity for one’s shutting
himself up in a stove.</p>

<p>Descartes says: “Now I shall shut my eyes,
I shall stop my ears, I shall turn my senses
aside; I shall even efface from my memory
every image of corporeal objects, or at least,
as that can hardly be done, I will repute them
as vain and false; and thus, shut up within
myself, and contemplating what is within me,
I shall endeavour gradually to become more
and more familiarly acquainted with my own
real nature.”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>According to Gall, there is no occasion for
this absolute gathering one’s self together
within. All that is needful is to look at
and touch the skulls of people. Gall’s doctrine
succeeded just as Lavater’s did. Men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
will always be looking out for external signs
by which to discover secret thoughts and concealed
inclinations: it is vain to confound their
curiosity upon this point: after Lavater came
Gall; after Gall some one else will appear.</p>

<p>We soon become wearied of a true philosophy,
because it is true; because the search
after truth, of whatsoever kind, requires
strenuous and continual efforts. It is impossible,
moreover, always to have the very same
philosophy: even the same philosopher cannot
be always approved of. Approbation must
change its object, especially in France.</p>

<p>It was for the French that Fontenelle wrote
these words: “The approbation of mankind
is a sort of forced state, which seeks nothing
so much as to come to an end.”<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Descartes goes off to die in Sweden, and
Gall comes to reign in France.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV.<br />
OF SPURZHEIM.</h2>

</div>

<p>Spurzheim published two works; the first
of which is entitled, “Observations sur la
Phrénologie, ou la connaissance de l’homme
moral et intellectuel, fondée sur les fonctions
du système nerveux:”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> the title of the second
is, “Essai philosophique sur la nature morâle
et intellectuelle de l’homme;”<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and these two
works are merely a reproduction of the doctrine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
of Gall. Spurzheim makes Gall’s book
over again—the same book that they commenced
together—and abridges it.</p>

<p>Spurzheim tells us how he heard Gall, and
having heard him, felt himself drawn to participate
in his labours, and propagate his
doctrine.</p>

<p>“In 1800, I attended for the first time a
course of lectures which M. Gall had from
time to time repeated at Vienna for four years.
He spoke then of the necessity there was
for a brain to give out the manifestations of
the soul; and of the plurality of organs; ...
but he had not as yet begun to examine into
the structure of the brain.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> From the very
first, I found myself much attracted by the
doctrine of the brain; and from the period of
my first attention to that subject to the present
moment, I have never lost sight of it as an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
object of study. After finishing my studies in
1800, I joined M. Gall, in order to pursue in
a special manner the anatomical part of the
researches.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> In 1805, we left Vienna for the
purpose of travelling together; from which
time, up to the year 1813, we made our
observations in common,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>In fact, the two authors, uniting their
labours, first published, in 1808, their fine
memoir upon the anatomy of the brain,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and
subsequently, in 1810 and 1812, the two first
volumes of Gall’s great work.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1813 they separated, and that
separation even proved useful. Gall, when
writing independently, has a freer movement.
Had he continued united with Spurzheim, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
either would not have written the last chapter
of his fourth volume, or he would have written
it very differently, and we should not have
obtained the definite expression of his doctrine.</p>

<p>That chapter, entitled “Philosophy of Man,”
is Gall’s philosophy entire. It is in that chapter
that he says what he does understand by faculties,
by understanding, by will, &amp;c. &amp;c. and
it is there that he defines the faculties of the
individual understandings;<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> understanding, a
simple <i>attribute of each faculty</i>;<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> will, a
simple result of the simultaneous action of
superior faculties, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Spurzheim never would have imagined the
doctrine: he found it already concocted; he
follows it, and in doing so, always hesitates.
He did not imagine it; and perhaps never
could have had the facilities enjoyed by Gall
for carrying it successfully into the world.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
Gall’s mind was full of address. We have
seen his method of studying men.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> In his
great work there is a dominant tone of philosophy;
for the doctrine was already established
at the period of the publication of that
work. When the doctrine was inchoate, Gall’s
tone was not quite so grave, for it is above
all things necessary to awaken the public
curiosity, and the philosophic tone does not
answer for that purpose.</p>

<p>Charles Villers has preserved some of his
souvenirs, touching the first impressions produced
by the doctrine.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> “If,” writes Gall at
the period in question, “the exterminating
angel was under my orders, wo to Kæstner,
to Kant, to Wieland, and others like them....
Why is it, that no one has ever preserved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
for our times, the skulls of Homer, Virgil,
Cicero, &amp;c.?”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>“At one time,” says Charles Villers, “every
body in Vienna was trembling for his head,
and fearing that after his death it would be
put in requisition to enrich Dr. Gall’s cabinet.
He announced his impatience as to the skulls
of extraordinary persons—such as were distinguished
by certain great qualities or by great
talents—which was still greater cause for the
general terror. Too many people were led to
suppose themselves the objects of the doctor’s
regards, and imagined their heads to be especially
longed for by him, as a specimen of the
utmost importance to the success of his experiments.
Some very curious stories are told
on this point. Old M. Denis, the Emperor’s
librarian, inserted a special clause in his will,
intended to save his cranium from M. Gall’s
scalpel.”<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>Gall and Spurzheim differ from each other
upon several points: upon the offices of the
external senses; upon the names of the faculties
of the soul; upon their number; and upon
the classification of the faculties, &amp;c. Let
us examine a few of the points more particularly.</p>

<p>1. <i>Offices of the external senses.</i> “M. Gall
is disposed,” says Spurzheim, “to attribute to
the external senses, as well as to each and
every internal faculty, not only perception,
but also memory, reminiscence, and judgment....
It seems to me that such facts (the facts
cited by Gall) do not prove the conclusion.
In the first place, memory, being nothing more
than the repetition of knowledge, must have
its seat in the point where perception takes
place. The impressions of the nerves that
give rise to the sensation of hunger, &amp;c. are
indisputably perceived in the head, which
likewise has the reminiscence of hunger....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
I do not believe we can conclude that the eyes
or the ears are the seats of reminiscence.”<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Spurzheim is right, as we have sufficiently
seen;<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> perception is not in the organ of the
sense.</p>

<p>But the error that Spurzheim combats is not
the whole of Gall’s error; it is only a particular
and secondary error:<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> the error that he
does not perceive, the error that he follows, is
a general and capital one. From the independence
of the external senses, Gall concludes
the independence of the faculties of the soul:
he reasons upon an apparent analogy, which
conceals a profound dissimilitude; and Spurzheim
reasons just as Gall does.</p>

<p>“In the nervous system,” says he, “we
find the five external senses separate and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
independent of each other.”<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> “The faculties
of the external senses are attached to different
organs; they may exist separately. The same
holds true of the internal senses.”<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> “We
assert that there is a particular organ for
each species of sentiment or thought, as there
is for each species of exterior sensation.”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Like Gall, Spurzheim denominates the faculties
of the soul <i>internal senses</i>; in the same
spirit he says: “The <i>sense of colour</i>, the
<i>sense of number</i>, <i>sense of language</i>, <i>sense of
comparison</i>, <i>sense of causality</i>,”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Both authors begin by calling the faculties
of the soul <i>internal senses</i>; and then, misled
by the word, they conclude from the <i>independence
of the external senses</i>, to the <i>independence</i>
of their <i>internal senses</i>; that is to say,
the independence of the faculties of the soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>2. <i>Names of the faculties.</i> Spurzheim accuses
Gall of having given denominations only
to actions, and not to the principles of those
actions.</p>

<p>“Finding,” says he, “a relation betwixt
the development of a cerebral part and a
sort of action, M. Gall denominated the cerebral
part from the action; thus, he spoke of
the organs of music, poetry, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> “The
nomenclature,” says he further, “ought to
be conformed to the faculties, without regard
to any action whatever.... When we attribute
to an organ cunning, management, hypocrisy,
intrigue, &amp;c. we do not make known the
primary faculty which contributes to all these
modified actions.”<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Gall replies: “M. Spurzheim cannot have
forgotten how often we reasoned without end,
with a view to determine the primitive destination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
of an organ.... I confess, that there
are several organs, with whose primary faculties
I am not yet acquainted; and I continue
to denominate them from the degree of activity
that led me to the discovery of them. M.
Spurzheim thinks himself more fortunate: his
metaphysical temperament has led him to the
discovery of the fundamental or primitive
faculty of every one of the organs. Let us
put it to the proof.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, Spurzheim’s expedient for rendering
himself master of the primary faculties is
very simple. He creates a word: he calls the
instinct of propagation <i>amativity</i>, the propensity
to steal, <i>convoitivity</i>; courage is <i>combativity</i>,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Gall and Spurzheim talk a great deal about
nomenclature; but they do not perceive, that
as to nomenclature, the first difficulty, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
indeed the only one, is to get at simple facts.
Whoever has come to simple facts, is very
nigh to a good nomenclature.</p>

<p>Descartes says: “Had some one clearly
explained the simple ideas that exist in the
imagination of men, and which constitute all
that they think, I should venture to hope for
a language that it would be very easy to
learn, ... and, which is the principal matter,
that would assist the judgment, representing to
it things so distinctly that it would be almost
impossible for it to be deceived; whereas, on
the contrary, the words we now have possess,
so to speak, only confused significations, to
which the human mind has been so long accustomed,
that it therefore understands scarcely
any thing perfectly well.”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>3. <i>Number of the faculties.</i> Spurzheim
adds eight faculties to those established by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
Gall, and Gall is vexed by it. One does not
see why.</p>

<p>What! Shall Gall endow twenty-seven
faculties, and Spurzheim not have the same
privilege for seven or eight?<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Shall Gall have
a faculty for <i>space</i>, one for <i>number</i>, &amp;c. and
Spurzheim be refused one for <i>time</i>, one for
<i>extent</i>, &amp;c.? Is not Spurzheim half right,
when he says:</p>

<p>“One does not readily perceive why M. Gall
should desire to suggest to his readers that his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
method of treating the doctrine of the brain
is the only admissible one, and that there are
no other organs than those he has recognised;
that the organs do nothing but what he attributes
to them; ... that all he says and all
he does (and that only) bears the stamp of
perfection; and that his decision constitutes
the supreme law.”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>4. <i>Classification and attributes of the
faculties.</i> Gall, by giving the same attributes
to all the faculties, and to each faculty all the
attributes of the understanding, in fact forms
out of the faculties only two groups: the group
of faculties that he supposes common to man
and the animals, and the group of faculties
that he supposes to be proper to man alone.
Spurzheim divides and subdivides them.</p>

<p>None of the formulas required for the classification
agreed upon are omitted.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>In the first place, there are two <i>orders</i> of
faculties: the <i>affective</i> and the <i>intellectual
faculties</i>; then each of these <i>orders</i> is divided
into <i>genera</i>. The first <i>order</i> has two <i>genera</i>:
the affective faculties common to man and
animals,<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> and the affective faculties peculiar
to man alone.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The second has three genera:
the faculties or <i>internal senses</i> which make
external objects known;<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> the faculties or
internal senses which make known the relations
of objects in general;<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> and the faculties
or internal senses that <i>reflect</i>.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>What an apparatus for saying very simple
things; for saying that there are <i>propensities</i>,<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
<i>sentiments</i>,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> and <i>intellectual faculties</i>!
What singular personification of all these
faculties: faculties that know; faculties that
reflect!<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Spurzheim elsewhere speaks of
<i>happy faculties</i>.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Indeed, what arbitrariness
in the distribution of facts! And Gall, too,
is he not half right?</p>

<p>“By what right,” says he, “does M. Spurzheim
exclude from the intellectual faculties
imitation, wit, ideality or poetry, circumspection,
secretivity, constructivity? How are perseverance,
circumspection, imitation; how are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
they sentiments? What reason have we for
counting among the propensities constructivity
rather than melody, benevolence, or
imitation?”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>Gall, by endowing each faculty with all the
attributes of an understanding, makes as many
understandings as faculties. Spurzheim makes
several kinds of understandings: understandings
that know, understandings that reflect,
&amp;c. He restores the <i>sensitive</i> and <i>rational
souls</i>.</p>

<p>In fine, Gall and Spurzheim rarely agree
as to their faculties. In <i>hope</i> Gall sees nothing
more than an attribute; Spurzheim beholds it
as a primary faculty. In <i>conscience</i> Gall sees
nothing but an effect of <i>benevolence</i>; Spurzheim
looks upon it as a peculiar faculty.
Gall resolves that there is only one organ of
<i>religion</i>, and Spurzheim insists upon three—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
organ of causality, that of supernaturality,
and that of veneration, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>We should never end, were we to follow
them throughout their debates. I have said
enough to show the case, and I now pass
on to Broussais.</p>

OF BROUSSAIS.</h2>

</div>

<p>Broussais appears to have been born solely
for the purpose of imagining or propagating
systems.</p>

<p>Guided by facts which he seized upon with
a rare sagacity, Broussais begins by bringing
back certain affections to their real seats;<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
but soon, by an immoderate generalization of
this fine result, he perceives all affections in
the same affection, all diseases in the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
malady; he imagines one <i>abstract affection</i>,
by means of which he explains all other
affections: <i>fevers</i> are nothing but irritations
of the digestive apparatus; <i>insanity</i> is nothing
but an <i>irritation</i> of the brain;<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> and he who
is so intolerant of the <i>personifications</i> proposed
by others, makes one <i>personification</i>
more; in fine, his exclusive and headstrong
genius carries him beyond himself, and, as if
merely to amuse him after the fatigue of forming
his systems, plunges him into the question
of <i>phrenology</i>, where he enjoys himself so
much the more, because he finds in it his
own accustomed method, his own ideas, and
his own language: there are plenty of faculties
to bring back to their organs, plenty of localizations
to establish.</p>

<p>Broussais ought not to be judged of by his
“Cours de Phrénologie.”<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> The five or six<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
first <i>lessons</i>, or, as he calls them, <i>generalities</i>,<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
are merely a confused mixture of ideas: the
notions of Condillac rejected by Cabanis, and
the ideas of the phrenologists.</p>

<p>He says that sensibility is the <i>common
origin</i> of the faculties;<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> he calls <i>perception</i>
a <i>primary faculty</i>,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> &amp;c. &amp;c.; and Condillac
would not speak differently.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, he says that there
are as many <i>memories</i> as there are organs;<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
that the instincts and the sentiments possess
a memory, as the <i>external perceptions</i><a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> have
theirs; that the mind is the <i>sum of the faculties</i>,<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
&amp;c.; and Gall could not say it more
clearly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>Broussais is particularly opposed to the <i>moi</i>
of Descartes. “Seduced,” says he, “by the
<i>moi</i> of Descartes, philosophers have been led
to reason according to the testimony of their
consciousness....”<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> And according to what
testimony does Broussais think they ought to
reason?</p>

<p>He thinks it very funny to call the <i>moi</i> an
<i>intra-cranial entity</i>,<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> <i>intra-cranial central
being</i>,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> <i>person</i> par excellence, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>He laughs at the <i>moi</i> of Descartes; he
forgets that the <i>moi</i> of Gall is either nothing
else than the sum (<i>ensemble</i>) of the
intellectual faculties, or nothing else than a
word; and he makes for himself a <i>peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
moi</i>,<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> which he locates in the organ of <i>comparison</i>.
“We owe,” says he, “to the organ
of general comparison the distinction of one
person expressed by the sign <i>me</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Broussais was never designed for compliance
with the ideas of others; a yoke oppresses
him; he is never truly Broussais, except in
the midst of conflict. In 1816 he publishes a
volume,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and the medical doctrines are shook<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
for half a century: we ought to read that
volume over again, and forget the “Cours
de Phrénologie.”</p>

BROUSSAIS’S PSYCOLOGY.</h2>

</div>

<p>The fact is, Broussais is busier with his
own opinions than with what Gall thought;
and here is a specimen of his way of thinking:
“The understanding and its different
manifestations are,” says he, “the phenomena
of the nervous actions.”<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> “The faculties,”
says he further, “are the actions of the material
organs,”<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>Broussais’s whole psycology is contained in
these words. The organ, and the phenomenon
produced by the organ. To speak more
clearly, the organ and the action of the
organ. To speak like Cabanis, the organ
and the <i>secretion</i> of the organ, or <i>thought</i>.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
That’s all!</p>

<p>The understanding, therefore, is merely a
<i>phenomenon</i>, a product, an act. But if this
be the case, how can there be a <i>continuity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
of the moi</i>? Now, the consciousness which
gives me the <i>unity</i> of the <i>moi</i>, gives me
not less assuredly the <i>continuity</i> of the <i>moi</i>.
Descartes’ admirable words are: “I find that
there is in us an <i>intellectual memory</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The consciousness tells me that I am <i>one</i>,
and Gall insists that I am <i>multiple</i>; the consciousness
tells me I am <i>free</i>, and Gall avers
that there is no <i>moral liberty</i>; the consciousness
endows me with the continuity of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
understanding, but Cabanis and Broussais tell
me that my understanding is nothing but
an <i>act</i>.</p>

<p>Philosophers will talk.</p>

BROUSSAIS’S PHYSIOLOGY.</h2>

</div>

<p>The whole of Broussais’s physiology is
founded upon <i>irritation</i>. He says, “Irritation
constitutes the basis of the physiological
doctrine.”<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> But what is irritation? Broussais
replies: “It is the exaggeration of contractility.”<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
But then, what is <i>contractility</i>?</p>

<p>In Haller, the term <i>irritability</i> (for that is
his term for <i>contractility</i>) possesses a precise
meaning and import. <i>Irritability</i> is a property<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
of muscular fibre, by which it shortens
or contracts itself when touched.</p>

<p>Haller demonstrated, and it is his glory,
that the muscle alone <i>moves</i> when it is
touched. What is that to Broussais? He
goes back again to the vague irritability of
Glisson and de Gorter: like those authors, he
assigns it to every tissue, and, like them, he
explains every thing by means of it.</p>

<p>Broussais’s <i>irritation</i> is merely Haller’s
<i>irritability</i> exaggerated and deformed.</p>

<p>The genius of Broussais was too impatient
to allow him to proceed step by step up to
the idea—too impassioned to hinder him from
being satisfied with the name—and for that
very reason he appears to have been by nature
fitted for success in a school where the name
is every thing.</p>

<p>But here is the great difference. Gall and
Broussais laboured for the School: Descartes
toiled for the human mind.</p>

</div>

<p>I return to Gall.</p>

<p>Those who wish to learn Gall’s doctrine,
will always go up to Gall himself. Spurzheim
already alters the spirit of that doctrine,
and Gall complains of it. “M. Spurzheim,”
says he, “knows my discoveries better than
any body else, but he tries to introduce among
them a spirit quite foreign to that in which
they were begun, continued and perfected.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>Gall, moreover, was a great anatomist. His
idea of tracing the fibres of the brain is, as to
the anatomy of that organ, the fundamental
idea. The idea is not his own: two French
anatomists, Vieussens and Pourfour du Petit,
had admirably understood it long before his
time; but at the period of his appearance it
had been long forgotten. The brain was not
then dissected by any one: it was cut in slices.</p>

<p>It was a great merit in Gall to have recalled
the true method of dissecting the brain; and
there was still greater address on his part, in
connecting with his labours in positive anatomy,
his doctrine of independent faculties and
multiple brain.</p>

<p>This strange doctrine has had a fortune still
more strange. Gall and Spurzheim forgot to
place <i>curiosity</i> among their primary faculties.
They were wrong. But for the credulous
curiosity of mankind, how could they have
explained the success of their doctrine?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>Fortunately, a system never lives otherwise
than as a system lives. That of the moment
is abandoned for the sake of another: and
almost always for a perfectly opposite one.
Systems multiply and pass away; and we
are indebted to the systems themselves for an
escape from the mischiefs of systems.</p>

and the Organs of the Intellectual Faculties.</span></p>

<p><a href="#Page_82">Page 82.</a> <i>According to Gall, the origin, the development,
the structure and mode of termination, as to
the organs of the faculties of the soul and the organs
of the external senses, every thing is similar, every
thing is in common.</i></p>

</div>

</div>

<p>It is known that two substances compose the nervous
system—the gray matter, and the white or fibrous matter.
Well, according to Gall, one of these substances
produces the other. The <i>gray matter</i> produces the
<i>white matter</i>.</p>

<p>Wherever, therefore, there happens to be any <i>gray
matter</i>, white matter must appear; that is to say,
<i>nervous fibres</i>,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> <i>nervous filaments</i>, nerves. All the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
nerves in the body must arise in this way. The spinal
nerves arise from the gray matter which is in the interior
of the spinal marrow; the cerebral nerves from
the gray matter that is in the interior of the medulla
oblongata.</p>

<p>Hence, the nerves of the body are <i>organs of the senses</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the brain and the cerebellum,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
which are <i>the organs of the faculties of the soul</i>, must
arise like the nerves: the brain from the gray matter
of the <i>pyramidal eminences</i>; the cerebellum from the
gray matter that surrounds the <i>restiform bodies</i>.</p>

<p>In the second place, whenever a nerve traverses a
mass of gray matter, it receives from it, according to
Gall, certain new nervous filaments; and in this way
it grows and developes itself. The cerebrum and cerebellum
will not fail therefore to grow and be developed
likewise. The primitive bundles of the cerebellum,
(<i>the restiform bodies</i>,) will grow by means of the filaments
which will be imparted to them by the gray
matter of the <i>ciliary body</i>: the primitive bundles of
the cerebrum, (the <i>pyramidal eminences</i>,) by the filaments
imparted to them by, first, the gray matter of the
<i>pons varolii</i>; secondly, by that of the <i>optic strata</i>;
and then by that of the olivary bodies, <i>corpora striata</i>,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Finally, in the same manner as a nerve of sense
expands at its termination, and by means of such expansion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
forms the organ of the sense, so the primitive
bundles of fibres of the brain and of the cerebellum
terminate in expansions, and constitute the <i>organs
of the internal senses</i>; that is to say, the lobes of the
cerebellum and the hemispheres of the brain.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p><a href="#Footnote_79">Page 64 (Note).</a> <i>And he does not see that as to
the instincts and the understanding all is contrast.</i></p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Here is what I have elsewhere said upon this question,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
so long debated, of the <i>instinct and understanding
of animals</i>.</p>

<p>“There is a most complete difference between
<i>instinct</i> and <i>understanding</i>.</p>

<p>“In <i>instinct</i> all is blind, necessary, and invariable.
In <i>understanding</i> every thing is elective, conditional,
and modifiable.</p>

<p>“The beaver which builds its house, and the bird
that constructs its nest, act only by instinct.</p>

<p>“The dog and the horse, that learn even the meaning
of several of our words, and who pay obedience
to us, do so by understanding.</p>

<p>“In <i>instinct</i> all is innate. The beaver builds without
having learned to build: all that he does is from
fatality. The beaver builds under the impulsion of a
constant and irresistible force.</p>

<p>“In <i>understanding</i>, every thing results from experience
and <i>instruction</i>. The dog obeys only because
he has learned to obey: he is perfectly free in this
respect; for he obeys only because he will obey.</p>

<p>“Finally, in regard to <i>instinct</i> every thing is particular.
That admirable industry that the beaver exhibits
in the construction of his hut, can be employed in
no other occupation than the building of his hut. Now,
in <i>understanding</i> every thing is general; for the dog
could apply the same flexibility of attention, and of
conception, which he uses in obeying, to do any other
thing.</p>

<p>“In animals there are, therefore, two distinct and
primary forces—<i>instinct</i> and <i>understanding</i>. As long
as our conceptions of these forces were confused, all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
our views and opinions in regard to the actions of animals
remained obscure and contradictory. Among
these actions, some exhibited man every where superior
to the brute; while others appeared to accord to the
brute creation the superiority over man—a contradiction
almost as deplorable as absurd! By the distinction
that separates blind and necessary actions from elective
and conditional ones—or, in a word, instinct from intelligence—all
contradiction disappears, and order succeeds
to confusion. Whatever in animals is <i>understanding</i>,
does not in any degree approach the excellence
of the human understanding; and whatsoever,
under the appearance of <i>understanding</i>, seemed superior
to the human understanding, is in fact a mere result
of a mechanical and blind force.”<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>Here is what I say as to the boundaries between the
intelligence of man and of animals.</p>

<p>“Animals receive, through their senses, impressions
similar to those that we receive through the medium of
our senses; like ourselves, they retain the traces of
these impressions: these impressions, when preserved,
form for them, as well as for us, numerous and various
associations: they combine them, they draw from them
inferences, and deduce judgments from them: therefore
they possess understanding.</p>

<p>“But the whole of their understanding stops at that
point. The understanding they possess is not one that
can consider itself: it cannot see itself, does not know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
itself. They do not possess <i>reflection</i>, that supreme
faculty with which the mind of man is endowed, and
which enables him to turn his intellectual power
inwards, so as to study and know the nature of his own
understanding.</p>

<p>“Reflection, thus defined, is then the boundary that
separates human intelligence from that of the brute
creation: and in fact it cannot be denied that this furnishes
a strong line of demarcation between them.
Thought, which contemplates itself; understanding,
which sees itself and studies itself; knowledge, which
knows itself; these evidently constitute an order of
determinate phenomena of a decided character, and to
which no brute animal can ever attain. This is, if one
might so speak, a purely intellectual domain; and it
appertains to man alone. In one word, animals feel,
know, think; but man is the only one of all created
beings to whom has been given the power of feeling
that he feels, of knowing that he knows, and of thinking
that he thinks.”<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>I will quote, also, the following passage from my
work sur <i>l’instinct et l’intelligence des animaux</i>, p.
178, et seq.</p>

<p>“ ... There are three facts: <i>instinct</i>, <i>understanding
of brutes</i>, and <i>human understanding</i>; and
each of these facts has its definite limits.</p>

<p>“Instinct acts without knowing; understanding
knows in order to act; the human understanding alone
knows, and knows itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>“Reflection, closely defined, is the <i>knowledge of
thought by thought</i>. And this power of thought over
thought gives us a whole order of new relations. As
soon as the mind perceives itself it judges itself; as
soon as it can act upon itself it is free; as soon as it
becomes free it becomes moral.</p>

<p>“Man is only moral because he is free.</p>

<p>“The brute animal follows its body; in the midst
of this body, which shrouds it completely in matter, the
human mind is free, and so free that it can, whenever
it prefers to do so, immolate its very body.</p>

<p>“‘The great power of the will over the body,’ says
Bossuet, ‘consists in this prodigious effect, that man
is so completely master of his frame, that he can even
sacrifice it for the sake of some greater good in view.
To rush into the midst of blows, and plunge into a
flight of arrows from a blind impetuosity, as happens
among brute creatures, shows nothing superior to the
body itself; but to resolve to die with understanding,
and for reasons, notwithstanding the whole disposition
of the body to the contrary, evinces a principle superior
to the body; and among all the tribes of animals,
man is the only one in whom this principle exists.’”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gall, as an Observer.</span></p>

<p><a href="#Page_93">Page 93.</a> <i>He studied them (mankind) in his own
way, but he studied them very closely.</i></p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Gall was a practical observer. He observed and
studied always, and with so much the greater success<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
because “people never suspected that they had to do
(these are his own words) with a man who knew perfectly
well that the basis of human character continues
to be always the same, and that merely the objects that
interest us change with the progress of years.”<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>He examined “families, schools, hospitals, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
And he never was satisfied with appearances only.
“The occupations that we pursue as our business, generally
prove nothing either as to our faculties or our
propensities: but those which we engage in as recreation
are almost always in conformity with our tastes
and our talents.”<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>His observations on men were more serviceable to
him in judging of and describing their characters, than
the <i>bumps on the skull</i>.</p>

<p>“I often said to my friends, show me the fundamental
forces of the soul, and I will find the organ and
the seat for each one of them.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> ... When I had become
convinced that a distinguished talent, and one fully so
recognised, was especially the work of nature, I examined
the head of the individual, ... &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Gall’s progression, then, was from <i>observation</i> to the
<i>cranium</i>; he first proceeded from <i>observation</i> to the
<i>cranium</i>, and next from the <i>cranium</i> to the <i>brain</i>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Gall began by studying the <i>physiognomy</i>—the
<i>features</i> of the <i>countenance</i>—like Lavater.</p>

<p>He at first thought that a good memory was connected
with a certain <i>conformation of the eyes</i>: “I
remarked,” says he, “that they all had large projecting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
eyes.... I suspected, therefore, that there ought
to exist some connexion between memory and this conformation
of the eyes.”<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Again he says, “It may be
perceived, from the progress of these researches, that
the first step consisted in the discovery of certain organs;
that it was by degrees only that we allowed facts
to speak in order to deduce from them general principles;
and that it was subsequently, and towards the
close, that we had learned to know the brain.”<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Thus it appears that the study of the brain came
later than the doctrine; and that is the reason why the
anatomy of the brain is a mere series of mistakes and
conjectures—I mean here the <i>special anatomy</i>, the
<i>secret anatomy</i>, the <i>phrenological anatomy</i>; I mean
the anatomy made out to suit the doctrine. I have
already sufficiently discriminated between it and the
<i>real anatomy</i>.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>Broussais explains every thing by the word <i>irritation</i>,
just as Gall explains every thing by the word
<i>faculties</i>, and as Malebranche explained them by <i>animal
spirits</i>.</p>

<p>After serving Descartes, the <i>animal spirits</i> were in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
the service of Malebranche; they served all the authors
of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Malebranche commences one of his chapters with
these words: “Every body agrees that the <i>animal
spirits</i>....”<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> He had no idea that every body would
agree some day, that the <i>animal spirits</i> is mere nonsense.</p>

<p>There were animal spirits of all sorts; as Gall had
<i>faculties</i> of all sorts: there were <i>agitated</i><a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> animal
spirits, <i>languid</i> animal spirits.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> There were even
<i>libertine</i> animal spirits.</p>

<p>“Wine is so spirituous,” says Malebranche, “that it
is <i>animal spirits</i> almost completely formed, but libertine
spirits.”<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>The animal spirits seemed to have become the <i>ultima
ratio</i> of the philosophers.</p>

<p>The author of a book, in other respects to be esteemed,
thus defined <i>imagination</i>: “Imagination is a perception
of the soul’s caused by the internal motion of the
animal spirits.”<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>That author had no doubt that he was saying something.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Exaggeration of Broussais, even in Phrenology.</span></p>

<p><a href="#Page_120">Page 120.</a> <i>We ought to read that volume over
again, and forget the Cours de Phrénologie.</i></p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Broussais does not adopt merely the general ideas of
the phrenologists—he adopts even the smallest of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>Gall had located the <i>instinct</i> of <i>murder</i> in a given
part of the brain; and he supposed, be it understood,
that this part existed only in the brain of the carnivorous
animals. But see, it is found in the brain of the
herbivora; and one would suppose that the phrenologists
would be in trouble about it. Don’t deceive yourself,
the <i>instinct of murder</i> is the <i>instinct of destruction</i>.
Spurzheim denominates it <i>destructivity</i>; and
the herbivorous animals must possess it, for they eat
plants and consequently <i>destroy</i> them.</p>

<p>“The herbivora” says Broussais, “effect a real destruction
among plants.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> An attempt has been made to
turn these ideas into ridicule, even in an Academy....
It was in a learned society of this kind considered
ridiculous in the phrenologists to compare the destruction
of vegetables to that of animals. For my own
part I do not see why the idea should be rejected, if
the fundamental object of the organ be to procure the
means of alimentation, which seems to be quite certain.”<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>Gall imagines an organ for religion; he thinks it
peculiar to man, and denominates it the <i>Organ of
Theosophy</i>. The same organ is found quite down in
the scale as low as the sheep;<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> and do not suppose
that Broussais is at all shocked by the discovery. If
necessary he will go further than all the phrenologists
taken together.</p>

<p>“The phrenologists” says he, “have denied that this
sentiment (the sentiment of veneration) belongs to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
animals. I am not of that opinion. A certain shade
of <i>veneration</i> exists in many species, among the vertebrate,
that choose their leaders, and march according
to a signal given by their chiefs and obey them. Thus
even among the sheep you may see a chief.”<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>Who would have believed it? Broussais finds Gall
too timorous.</p>

<p>“There is,” says he, “no central organ. This is
considered as one of the most powerful objections to
Gall. As far as I know he never answered it. As for
me, I shall be more frank, perhaps more bold: I shall
say it is impossible that there should be one, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p><a href="#Page_126">Page 126.</a> <i>He assigns it to every tissue, and, like
them, he explains every thing by means of it.</i></p>

</div>

</div>

<p>He assigns it to every tissue. Haller attributed this
property to the muscles alone, “but it is a common
property of the tissues.”<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>He explains every thing by means of it: every
thing, even <i>innervation</i> itself. But he is constrained to
add: “Doubtless <i>something more occurs</i> in the interior
of the nervous tissue; doubtless we are unacquainted
and ignorant as to how <i>that other thing</i> is connected
with the motions in question, and how it may employ
them in the act of innervation,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>So we perceive, in the first place, <i>contractility</i> explains
<i>innervation</i>; and then, that <i>something more</i> is
wanting. And as nervous contractility is nothing but
a mental fiction (a nerve never moves, never <i>contracts</i>,
when it is touched) the whole matter tapers down to
this <i>something more</i>, or to <i>that other thing</i>.</p>

<p>See how very far from being rigorous are those who
construct systems.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_128">Page 128.</a> <i>Gall, moreover, was a great anatomist.</i></p>

</div>

</div>

<p>He found that the medullary substance of the brain
was fibrous throughout;<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> he saw the fibres of the medulla
oblongata decussate before they form the pyramidal
eminences,<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> those of the corpora olivaria, &amp;c.;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
that is to say, all the ascending fibres of the medulla
oblongata across the pons varolii, thalami nervor opticorum,
and the corpora striata, as far as the vault of
the hemispheres; he saw the bundles formed by these
fibres increased in magnitude at each of these passages;
he distinguished the fibres which go out in order
to expand in the hemispheres, from those that go in in
order to give birth to the commissures: many nerves
that were regarded as coming out immediately from the
brain, were by him traced even into the medulla oblongata,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>And I repeat that all these facts, with the discovery
of which he has enriched the science of anatomy, all
of them are the results of a happy thought of his—the
idea of <i>tracing</i> the fibres of the brain, or to use
a common expression, of substituting in the dissection
of the brain the method of <i>developments</i> for that of
<i>sections</i>.</p>

<p>Those of Gall’s opinions which it seems ought not to
be adopted, are: that in which he supposes the nerve
fibres to be born (he understands the word to the letter)
of the gray matter; that in which he contends that the
convolutions of the brain are merely foldings of the
medullary fibres, and can therefore be <i>unfolded</i>; that
in which he compares the rete mucosum of the skin
to the gray matter of the encephalon, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Gall had a mind which impelled him to the formation
of hypotheses; and even in his real anatomy there
is a decided smack of a system-author.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_117" href="#FNanchor_117" class="label">[117]</a> It is curious to see how M. Vimont, a very decided phrenologist
as well as an able anatomist, expresses himself on the
subject of the <i>localizations</i> of Gall and Spurzheim. “Gall’s
work,” says M. Vimont, “is fitter to lead into error than to
give a just idea of the seats of the organs.”—Traité de Phrén.
t. ii. p. 12. “Gall says he has remarked, that horses whose ears
are widely separated at the roots, are sure-footed and courageous.
Possibly the fact may be true; but I cannot comprehend the
connexion that may exist betwixt the outward mark and the
quality of courage, whose seat, in the horse, Gall indicates at a
point where there is no brain.”—Ibid. 281. “Spurzheim indicates
the region of the frontal sinuses as the seat of gentleness,
while courage is located upon the muscles that go to be inserted
on the os occipitis.”—Ibid. p. 117. Such are M. Vimont’s
remarks, yet this same M. Vimont inscribes the following
twenty-nine names on the skull of a goose!</p>

<p>“All this upon the cranium of a goose!” says M. Leuret
upon this occasion, (page 355.) “And there is no place so
small but it is occupied.... The faculties are so crowded,”
adds he, “that it would be a marvellous thing to be able to
write their names upon the brain.... It would be a greater

habitativity, order, time, right, supernaturality, hope, extent,
weight. Gall’s remarks upon these eight organs proposed by
Spurzheim are as follows: “M. Spurzheim, it is true, recognises
eight organs more than I admit. As to the organs of
habitativity, order, time, and supernaturality, I have already
spoken. I admit an organ of the moral sense, or sense of
right (<i>juste</i>), but I have very strong reasons for believing
that benevolence is nothing more than a very strong manifestation
of the moral sense; therefore I treat these two organs
under the rubric of a single organ. What M. Spurzheim
says on the organs of hope, of extent, and of weight, has
not as yet convinced me: and, in fact, he has hitherto proved
nothing in respect to them.”—T. iii. p. 25.</p>

organ—the organ of general comparison: “We owe to the
organ of general comparison the distinction of our person
expressed by the sign <i>me</i>.”—Cours de Phrén., p. 684. Further
on it comes from two—the organ of comparison and the organ
of causality: “The organ of causality is as necessary to the
distinction of the <i>me</i>, and of the <i>person</i>, as the organ of general
comparison.”—Ibid. p. 685. Next there is no organ at all:
“To assign to the <i>me</i> a special organ appears to me to be out
of the question.”—Ibid. p. 119. And then it comes from every
where: “There is no special and central organ, and our
perception of ourselves has for its basis the sensitive perceptions.”—Ibid.

intra-cranial being, to which they attribute all the faculties of a
man, is not cognisable by any of our senses, ... it is therefore a
pure hypothesis.”—Ibid. p. 153. Thus there is no <i>mind</i> (pure
hypothesis); no <i>faculties</i> but those of the <i>organs</i> (the faculties
are the acts of <i>material organs</i>); no understanding, except as
a simple phenomenon of the nervous action (understanding
and all its manifestations are <i>phenomena of nervous action</i>);
consequently, there is no psycology; there is nothing but physiology;

of the soul. “I cannot,” says he, “conceive otherwise
of those who die, than that they pass into a more pleasing and
tranquil life than ours, even carrying with them the remembrance
of the past: for I find there is within us an intellectual
memory.... And although religion teaches us many things
upon this subject, I must, notwithstanding, confess my infirmity
on this point, which it appears to me that I possess in common
with most people, which is, that although we might wish to
believe, and even might suppose ourselves to be firm believers
in the doctrines of religion, we are not so deeply touched with
those things that are taught by faith alone, and which our mere
reason cannot attain, as by those that are instilled into us by
natural and very evident reasons.”—T. viii. p. 684.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_184" href="#FNanchor_184" class="label">[184]</a> The white matter is every where fibrous. No person has
contributed more than Gall to the demonstration of this great
fact. He justly remarks: “Those authors who, with Sœmmerring
and Cuvier, &amp;c., recognise the fibrous structure of the brain,
in many of its parts, have nevertheless, not yet ventured to say
that it is so in all its parts.”—T. i. 235.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_185" href="#FNanchor_185" class="label">[185]</a> The cerebellum serves only for the motions of locomotion.
(See the first article of this work.) But, I am here setting forth
Gall’s opinions.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_186" href="#FNanchor_186" class="label">[186]</a> “The particular systems of the brain terminate in fibrous
expansions arranged in layers, just as the other nervous systems
expand in fibres at their peripheral extremity.”—T. i. 318. “All
the diverging bundles of the brain, after they come out from
the last apparatus of reinforcement, expand in layers and form
convolutions.”—T. i. 283. “The nerves of sensation and motion
expand in the skin and the muscles; the nerves of the
senses, each in the external instrument to which they belong:
for example, the pituitary membrane upon the bones of the nose:
the nerve of taste in the tongue, and the expansion of the optic
nerve in the retina.... Nature obeys precisely the same
law in the brain. The different parts of the brain originate and
are reinforced at different points; they form fibrous bundles of
various sizes, which terminate in expansions. All these expansions
of the various bundles constitute, when reunited, the hemispheres
of the brain.”—T. iii. p. 3.</p>

<p>I here speak only of the <i>diverging fibres</i>. Coming from the
interior, they proceed towards the exterior: the <i>converging fibres</i>
coming from the exterior, that is, according to Gall, from the
gray matter that envelopes the brain and the cerebellum, are
directed inwards. The former constitute the <i>convolutions</i>,
while the latter compose the <i>commissures</i>. But I shall, further
on, return to this subject.</p>

you must confess that the disposal of these fibres must be
arranged with great skill, since the whole diversity of our feelings
and motions depend upon them. We wonder at the artifice
of the fibres in each muscle, but how much more are they worthy
of admiration in the brain, where these fibres, enclosed within so
small a space, perform each its own function without confusion

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
